Second step:         
Add repos:         
repo.coolstar.org         
kindadev.com/apt         
repo.fortysixandtwo.com          
noeliel.com/repo        

Install:         
Classic Fonts.         
Classic Badges (CoolStar repo).      
Classic Apps (not if 5s).      
CustomFolderIcon.       
LabelUp 7 (optional).     
NCWallpaper      

Go to reddit.com/r/flatdesignsucks        
Download Deflatify7.          
Install through iFile.         
Go to terminal and type "uicache".       
Redo your layout since you will have extra apps

Open iFile. (5s Only).        
Go to /var/mobile/library/preferences/.      

Look for com.apple.preferences.plist.      

Tap property list viewer.        
Tap the plus and type "UIUseLegacyUI" and select boolean.       
Look for it and enable it.         
Tap done.       

Kill settings app and enjoy classic look on the settings app. 

This trick can be done to all apps, but some May act more buggy than others. For example, photos UI becomes pretty ugly. Or they may just flat out won't work and crash. 
 
Optional:        
LabelUp7 has to be modified in the same folder we are on under the name of com.k0u.labelup7.plist. These are the values 

Delay -60        
DelayDock -2      
DelayFolder 0       
DelayIv 0      

For iOS 6 folder icon:          
CustomFolderIcon has a folder in the library folder under media in iFile. To theme it, you need the original iOS 6 folder image and such. Under library, go to customfoldericons folder and add iOS 6 folder icon within. To theme a folder, you need to name the file according to the folder name. 

Example:          
Folder is named "Extras".        
Icon has to be named "Extras@2x.png".       

Add the "@2x" since the tweak is size aware. 


Next step          
Look for the iOS 6 linen. Add it to your photo library. Select it in NCWallpaper for NC and CC if wanted.  Disable blur and enable hooks. Enjoy!
