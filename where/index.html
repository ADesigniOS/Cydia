<p>Hello, It's me Master!</p>

<div>
<p>Hey guys.  It's come to a time of year that happens every year where I must leave the world of technology for a month (21 days or comething like that) and I can't communicate with the outside :/.  During this time I will be unable to access and unable to help with bugs or anything so if you find one there isn't much I can do until I get back.  The repo will be modified to notice that I am not of access so don't spam me :p.  The bug reporter and blog will also reflect this as well.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I hope I haven't forgotten anything but to sum it up...<br><br>
-I'm gonna be gone<br>
-You're gonna miss me when I'm gone<br>
-You're gonna miss me by my walk<br>
-You're gonna miss me by my talk o<br>
-You're gonna miss me when I'm gone...</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But seriously.  I will be gone, I can't respond to anyone until I'm back (aka I'm coming back...)<br><br>Things will change quick and I hope to get some last minute changes onto FullSwitch before I leave.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But for now, goodbye... ;(</p>
