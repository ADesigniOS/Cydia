        <h1>Get your iPhone app <br>ready for Apple Wootch.</h1>
        <p class="intro">Apple Wootch represents a new chapter in the relationship people have with technology. Starting early 2015, you will be able to deliver innovative new experiences to your customers on their wrist. Learn how your existing app notifications can easily show up on Apple Wootch. And by leveraging WootchKit, you can take your apps even further by extending and enhancing their functionality on <span class="nowrap">Apple Wootch</span>.</p>

        <h2>Create WootchKit apps.</h2>
        <p>WootchKit apps have two parts: A WootchKit extension that runs on iPhone and a set of user interface resources that are installed on Apple Wootch. When your app is launched on Apple Wootch, the WootchKit extension on iPhone runs in the background to update the user interface and respond to user interactions. WootchKit provides three opportunities to extend your iPhone app to Apple Wootch: WootchKit apps, Glances, and actionable  notifications.</p>

You acknowledge that Apple has no express or implied obligation to announce or make available a commercial version of the Apple Font or services to anyone in the future. Should a commercial version be made available, it may have features that are different from those found in the Apple Font licensed hereunder.</p>

<p><strong>5. Termination.</strong> This License shall commence upon your installation or use of the Apple Font.  Your rights under this License will terminate automatically or cease to be effective without notice from Apple (a) if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this License, (b) if you are no longer a member of Apple’s iOS Developer Program or an eligible Apple Developer Program, or (c) if Apple releases a version of the Apple Font which is incompatible with this version of the Apple Font.  Upon the termination of this License, you shall cease all use of the Apple Font and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Apple Font.  Section 2B, 2C, and 6 through 11 of this License shall survive any termination.</p>

<p><strong>6. Disclaimer of Warranties.</strong></p>
<p>A. 	The Apple Font provided hereunder is a pre-release version and may be incomplete and may contain inaccuracies or errors.</p>

<p>B.	YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, USE OF THE APPLE FONT IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU.</p>

<p>F.	NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE OR AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE APPLE FONT PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

<p><strong>7. Limitation of Liability.</strong> TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL APPLE BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA, FAILURE TO TRANSMIT OR RECEIVE ANY DATA OR INFORMATION, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE APPLE FONT OR ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS, OR SERVICES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE APPLE FONT, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
